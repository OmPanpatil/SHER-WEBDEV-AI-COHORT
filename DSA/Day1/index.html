    <pre>Operator Precedence:
        Operator precedence defines the order in which operators are evaluated. Higher precedence operators are evaluated first.
        
        Here's the precedence of arithmetic operators in JavaScript (from highest to lowest):
        
        Parentheses () - Operations inside parentheses are performed first.
        Unary operators +, - (positive, negative signs) - Applied to a single value.
        Multiplication *, Division /, Modulus % - These have the same precedence and are evaluated left to right.
        Addition +, Subtraction - - These have the same precedence, evaluated left to right.</pre>
        <p>Arithmetic(+,-,/,*,%), Relational(>,>= vice-versa for greater than, !=), Logical(&&.||), Unary operator(++,--)</p>
