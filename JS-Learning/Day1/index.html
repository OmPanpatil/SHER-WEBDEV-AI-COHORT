        <h1>JavaScript</h1>

        <p>It is an interpreted language, dynamic language. Js was introduced and written by Brenden Eig. In 15 weeeks, so some of difficulties it got some errors. So, ecma script was introduced to right all the issues. Till 2015 es5 was going and then introduced was ES6 some more features was introduced with Let and Const.  </p>

        <h1>ðŸ“ŒFundamentals of computer</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Computer is an electronic device which takes some input, process it and gives Output. Abacus was the first computer. After that long time, and today we have trains, aeroplanes and these facilities weren't available at that time. Blaize pascal made a mechanical device which can calculate tax, or do operations in 1600 AD. Lebeniz made a changes into it multiplication , division features in it and improved it. And it was a mechanical device it didn't runs on electricity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Charles Badgage in 1800 made a difference engine based on mathematical formula. Which can do mathematical problems. And then they draft or prototype on paper every features and everything. They weren't known to us if miss Lady Adda lavlace wrote down and documentated the program. Miss lady adda lavlace wa a mathematician said to charles badgage if in this analyticsl program instruction store karde toh wou engine in instructions kae basses par automatically passes tayar kardegi. In that time, analytical program will run on instructions and these instructions can be given first. ANd this was the base for computers. And we would have been ahead in the future if proper funding were provided to charles sir. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In world war 2 during this period 1938, in germany Konrad Zeus was trying to make a computing device but stupid hitler said i can't provide u fundings. And without funding, Konrad Zeus made a computer Z1 series, Z2, Z3 and last Z4 with improved feature.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So in 1942, America Horward Akkins from Harward with IBM with funding of 1 Million dollar made a computer. But, we can say that Konrad Zeus is great because he made without funding. And we should appreciate sir Konrad Zeus.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So, like this our era of computer was started with the help of Konrad Zeus. But, laptops and desktop are the <span class="gpc">General purpose computer</span></p>
        <br>
        <h2>That's the reason: <span class="computer"> Computer is an electronic device which takes some input, process it and gives output.</span></h2>

                <h4>What is number system : We require something to measure anything and that is UNIT. for example: A boy having cows and goats he wants to calculate them and he wants to calculate how many cows are present with him for the gazing. And he grab some stones and he associates the cows with that stones. And now he keep the stones with him as a reference if any cow is lost after returning from Gazing the forest. So, like this symbols was introduced to calculate and remeber in that old time.</h4>
                <br>
                <h4>Symbols like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 0. These 10 symbols can make any numbers like 2 raise to 15. So, like these a system is present which represents it  10 as Deci, Octal as 8, Binary means two.</h4>
